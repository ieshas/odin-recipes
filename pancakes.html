          <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
          <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
          <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>1 3/4 cups milk</li>
          <li>1/4 cup butter</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Combine together the flour, sugar (or sweetener), baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large-sized
            bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the milk, slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and egg.
          </li>
          <li>Use a wire whisk to whisk the wet ingredients together first before slowly folding them into the dry
            ingredients. Mix together until smooth (there may be a couple of lumps but that's okay).</li>
          <li>Set the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or griddle</li>
          <li>Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a little butter to lightly grease
            pan. Pour ¼ cup of batter onto the pan and spread out gently into a round shape with the back of your ladle
            or measuring cup.</li>
          <li>When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip with a spatula and cook
            until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
          <li>Serve with honey, maple syrup, fruit, ice cream or frozen yoghurt, or enjoy plain!</li>
        </ol>
